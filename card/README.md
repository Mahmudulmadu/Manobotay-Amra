## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

In this task I could apply JS events I haven't used before, like focus and keyup. Furthermore, it was the first time working on form validation. I still have to study and learn more about it, but for now it's ok. Besides JS coding, CSS responsiveness is always a challenge, and in this project a learned more about it. 

### Continued development

- Form validation using Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Mobile-first workflow
